# NoSql Social Media API
 
## Description
 
This project uses express and mongoose as the base for building the back end of a basic social media API. The API can handle creating new users, updating user information, and deleting a user. It has the capacity for users to add other users as friends, as well as delete them as friends. Users can add thoughts (similar to making a post or a tweet) as well as update and delete those thoughts. They can also add reactions (similar to comments) to existing thoughts as well as delete those reactions. Social media API's are applicable to users as people with personal lives, as employees and owners of businesses, and as members of any number of platforms. The ways in which an API base like this could be implemented is nearly unlimited. 
 
## Usage
 
Open the project, run 'npm install', then run 'npm run dev'. There is no seeded information included, but information can be added manually through running the different routes.
Routes can be run using Insomnia or a similar platform.
